    <p>Hello, my name is David. I was born and raised in Vineland, NJ. I moved to Deptford, NJ in 2015 and in late 2018 I moved to King of Prussia, PA, which is where I now currently reside.  I started attending Cumberland County Community College in Vineland, NJ after high school, with the intent of getting an associates degree in engineering; however, about half way through, I switched my major to public administration, and graduated from community college with an associates degree in public administartion. After my graduation from community college, I transferred to Rutgers University, and graduated from there with a degree in Political Science. I have worked in the casino industry on and off for fifteen years, as either a dealer or a security guard. I have applied for a few jobs that relate to my political science degree; however, nothing ever materialized. I hope to one day start a new career in tech; however, it's definitely going to be a challenge, as the material gets more and more difficult. I would like to move to either West Virginia, Texas or Utah some day.</p><br>

    <h2><b>Travel Destinations</b></h2>

  <p>There are a few places around the World that I would like to visit. I don't really have any desire for a vacation at a tropical beach resort. I would much rather visit places, where hardly anybody has vacationed to, or where very few people have been. Here is my top ten list of places I would like to visit around the world.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Antarctica</li>
      <li>North Korea</li>
      <li>Serengeti National Park</li>
      <li>Mongolia</li>
      <li>Iran</li>
      <li>Kazakhstan</li>
      <li>United Kingdom</li>
      <li>Japan</li>
      <li>Germany</li>
      <li>Yellowstone National Park</li>
    </ol>
