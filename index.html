    <p>Hello, my name is David. I was born and raised in Vineland, NJ. I moved to Deptford, NJ in 2015 and in late 2018 I moved to King of Prussia, PA, which is where I now currently reside.  I started attending Cumberland County Community College in Vineland, NJ after high school, with the intent of getting an associates degree in engineering; however, about half way through, I switched my major to public administration, and graduated from community college with an associates degree in public administartion. After my graduation from community college, I transferred to Rutgers University, and graduated from there with a degree in Political Science. I have worked in the casino industry on and off for fifteen years, as either a dealer or a security guard. I have applied for a few jobs that relate to my political science degree; however, nothing ever materialized. I hope to one day start a new career in tech; however, it's definitely going to be a challenge, as the material gets more and more difficult. I would like to move to either West Virginia, Texas or Utah some day.</p>
